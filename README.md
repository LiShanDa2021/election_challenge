# Analysis of CO's 1st Congressional District Election

## Project Overview

A Colorado Board of elections asked us to audit a recent local congressional election. Since hundreds of thousands of votes were cast, they needed to automate this process. I did so using the Python programming language. As part of the audit I created a Python program titled PyPoll_Challenge.py to do the following.

1. Calculated the total number of votes cast.
3. Acquired a complete list of candidates who received votes.
4. Calculated the total number of votes each candidate received.
5. Calculated the percentage of votes each candidate won.
6. Determined the winner based on the popular vote.

## Resources

* Data Source: election_results.csv
* Software: Python 3.8.8

* There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
